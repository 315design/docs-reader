# Laravel Docs Site

This is the BETA docs reader application and can be used to easily review the documentation.

## Setup

- Clone this repo down and point a virtualhost at it's public dir like any other Laravel 4 app.
- Clone the 'daylerees/laravel-docs' repo into the 'docs' folder at the root of the 'laravel-docs-site' project.
- Visit the laravel docs site to preview the docs, make changes directly to the source in the DOCS folder ( ON A FEATURE BRANCH ).
- Tick #2 when you are done, and mention your review branch!

If you don't have time for a review then don't panic. Not trying to be bossy :)

Thanks for the help!
